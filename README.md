It is an art form that utilises pens, brush, hammer and chisel all made by either hand or machine. Many artists use this artform 
as a means of expression and the result shows the passion they have for a specific art style. Many have mastered the craft as it 
requires a steady hand, creativity, imagination yielding near to perfection result and the amount of time spent crafting that is often overlooked when we pass a
picture frame hanging on the walls in our homes , places of work, marketplaces etc.
